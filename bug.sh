#!/bin/bash

# This script attempts to process a file, but it handles errors poorly.

file_to_process="my_file.txt"

# Try to process the file.  If it fails, just exit without an error message.
if [ ! -f "$file_to_process" ]; then
  exit 1
fi

# Process the file (this is a placeholder)
cat "$file_to_process"

# The problem: If the file doesn't exist, the script exits silently.  
# A more robust script would provide a meaningful error message to the user.
